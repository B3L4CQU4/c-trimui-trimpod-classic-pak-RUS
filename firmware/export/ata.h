        0x0001 == Solid State
        0x0401 -> 0xffe == RPM
        All others reserved

        However, this is a relatively recent change, and we can't rely on it,
        especially for the FC1307A CF->SD adapters!

       Offset 168 is "Nominal Form Factor"
         all values >= 0x06 are guaranteed to be Solid State (mSATA, m.2, etc)

       Offset 169 b0 is set to show device implements TRIM.

    Unreliable mechanisms:

       Offset 83 b2 shows device implements CFA commands.
        However microdrives pose a problem as they support CFA but are not
        SSD.

       Offset 163 shows CF Advanced timing modes; microdrives all seems to
        report 0, but all others (including iFlash) report higher!  This
        is often present even when the "CFA supported" bit is 0.

       Offset 160 b15 indicates support for CF+ power level 1, if not set
        then device is standard flash CF.  However this is not foolproof
        as newer CF cards (and those CF->SD adapters) may report this.
