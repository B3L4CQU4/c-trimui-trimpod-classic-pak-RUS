/***************************************************************************
 * Trimpod: the HOLD (pocket-lock) screen.
 *
 * The Brick's side switch mutes all input (button_read_device() returns
 * BUTTON_NONE while engaged), which to a new user looks like a frozen app --
 * especially when Trimpod is launched with the switch ALREADY on.  So at launch
 * we show a "HOLD is ON" page instead of the main menu, and close it (-> main
 * menu) the moment the switch is released.
 *
 * It is an ordinary trimpod_page (see trimpod_page.h): the shared run loop owns
 * the enter transition, drawing, polling and exit, so it presents and behaves
 * exactly like every other screen -- no bespoke loop.
